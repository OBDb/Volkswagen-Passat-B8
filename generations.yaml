    description: "The Volkswagen Passat B8 represents the seventh-generation of the Passat lineup, built on Volkswagen's versatile MQB platform shared with numerous other Volkswagen Group products. Featuring clean, precise styling with a prominent horizontal grille, sharp character lines, and an overall more dynamic appearance than its predecessor, the B8 Passat maintains an understated elegance while incorporating more contemporary design elements. Available in four-door sedan and five-door wagon (Variant) body styles, this generation grew slightly in wheelbase while reducing overall length, creating more efficient proportions with enhanced interior space. Engine options vary by market but typically include a range of turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline and diesel units, with innovations including a plug-in hybrid GTE variant combining a 1.4-liter TSI engine with an electric motor for a combined 218 horsepower and approximately 50 kilometers of electric-only range. Transmission choices center around DSG dual-clutch automatics for most variants, with manual options available on some engines and 4MOTION all-wheel drive on selected higher-powered models. The interior features a more horizontal dashboard design with significantly enhanced technology, including a standard digital instrument cluster (Digital Cockpit), improved infotainment systems with enhanced connectivity, and advanced driver assistance features including semi-automated driving capabilities in Traffic Jam Assist. A mid-cycle update in 2019 brought revised styling, enhanced technology, and improved efficiency across the range. The B8 Passat carries forward the model's long-standing tradition of offering near-premium quality, sophisticated engineering, and advanced technology at a mainstream price point, maintaining its appeal to discerning buyers seeking substance over flash. However, the model has faced challenges from the industry-wide shift toward SUVs and crossovers, leading Volkswagen to limit or end production in some markets while continuing it in regions where mid-size sedans and wagons retain stronger popularity."
